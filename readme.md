# GAMETOY

A toy gameboy emulator written in python3.
There are already countless gameboy emulators available, this a project to help me learn about emulation.

## Usage

GAMETOY is used via the command line:

*   `./gametoy.py path_to_rom` to launch a rom
*   `./gametoy.py` to see possible arguments
